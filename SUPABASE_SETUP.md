# Supabase Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your Supabase database for the Hopeline application.

## Database Setup

1. Create a table named `reports` with the following columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reports (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  childName TEXT NOT NULL,
  age INTEGER NOT NULL,
  gender TEXT NOT NULL,
  lastSeenLocation TEXT NOT NULL,
  dateMissing TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  reporterName TEXT NOT NULL,
  reporterContact TEXT NOT NULL,
  reporterEmail TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  dateReported TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

2. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies if needed for additional security.

## Environment Variables

The application is already configured with your Supabase credentials in:
- Frontend: `.env.local` file 

If you need to change these credentials in the future:

1. Update the variables in the `.env.local` file:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Deployment

When deploying, make sure to set these environment variables in your hosting platform.

## How It Works

1. When a user submits a report on the Contact page, it is sent directly to Supabase.
2. Admin users can view and manage reports by fetching directly from Supabase.

No backend server is required as the frontend communicates directly with Supabase.
